Explanation

In this project, we made the sound and video broadcast. 
Here we have seen the implementation of socket structures. 
We've done the thread event for multiple clients. 
In order to run the project, we pay attention to be on the same port and on the same network. 
However, we are launching the server program. 
After the server has been run, 
the client will learn the IP address of the computer running the server and 
write to the required part in the client.
